# Level-Two Task-Two

This project consists of two main tasks: converting a basic webpage into a responsive design using CSS media queries and creating a mobile-friendly navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens using HTML and CSS.

## Files

1. **adaptive-index.html**: Converts a basic webpage into a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
2. **hamburger-index.html**: Creates a mobile-friendly navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens using HTML and CSS.
